# Resources, and their descriptions.
## Model files
### chem.json
* **Usage**. We only use the neuron name and type (Sensory, motor, interneuron).
  * Sensory - blue - group 1 - 84 - E.g. PLML 
  * Motor - red - group 2 - 109 - E.g. AS01, VD01
  * Interneuron - green - group 3 - 86 - E.g. AVAL, AVAR
* **Source**. From https://github.com/shlizee/C-elegans-Neural-Interactome/blob/master/chem.json
### Gg.npy, Gs.npy
* **Usage**. Number of synaptic and gap junctions between pairs of neurons. N x N matrix of integers.
* **Source**. From https://github.com/shlizee/C-elegans-Neural-Interactome/blob/master/Gg.npy 

### emask.npy
* **Usage**. Whether or not neuron in excitatory or inhibitory. An N-element array of 0-1's. 1 if inhibitory.
* **Source**. From https://github.com/shlizee/C-elegans-Neural-Interactome/blob/master/emask.npy 

## Dynamics files
### dynamics_fwd_5s.npy
* **Usage**. This file contains the **scaled** neuronal activity time series, which we will analyze.
* **Source**. Generated by running the [Interactome ](https://github.com/shlizee/C-elegans-Neural-Interactome) for 5s using the FWD setting.

### fwd_gold_seed_0_trial_1.npy, fwd_gold_seed_0_trial_2.npy
* **Usage**. Dynamics file from the paper, just with fixed seed. Took two samples to make sure that the fixed seeding really fixes the randomization. Then, either file can be used to check that our reproduced model exactly matches the results.
* **Source**. Generated by running the [Interactome ](https://github.com/shlizee/C-elegans-Neural-Interactome) for ~0.5s using the FWD setting, and using a fixed seed of 0 to generate the initial conditions in initialize.py.
